# go-client-examples

The Cloud API Client Examples uses the DynamicPDF Cloud API Go client library (`go-client`) to create, merge, split, form fill, stamp, obtain metadata, convert, and secure/encrypt PDF documents. This project contains numerous sample projects for the tutorials and examples on [cloud.dynamicpdf.com](https://cloud.dynamicpdf.com/).

The DynamicPDF Cloud API consists of the following endpoints.

- `dlex-layout`
- `image-info`
- `pdf`
- `pdf-info`
- `pdf-text`
- `pdf-xmp`

The GO client library (`go-client`) is available on Github ([go-client](https://github.com/dynamicpdf-api/go-client)). For more information, please visit [DynamicPDF Cloud API](https://cloud.dynamicpdf.com/). Support for other languages/platforms (Java, PHP, C#, Node.js, Python) is available on GitHub ([DynamicPDF Cloud API at GitHub](https://github.com/dynamicpdf-api)).
